            <p class="bookbrief">
              An atomic habit is a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do but is also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.
Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.
Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years.Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.
The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.
Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.

              Happy Literadia. My name is Anna Jeeswal, and I'm a 10th grader.
              I'm an avid reader, but not only reading, I also enjoy writing.
              The last book I read was The Strength in a Scars. The Strength in a Scars, it's been about how well we could gather ourselves and put the courage to reach our final potential.
              So if you're looking for encouragement and motivation, then this book is a fit for you.
              Thank you. Happy reading.
